You are an expert systems architect and research scientist. Generate a detailed technical breakdown of this paper.

Your output must be precise and technically rigorous. Automatically detect the paper type and adjust depth:
- If theoretical: provide deep mathematical derivations and proof logic
- If experimental: provide methodology analysis and reproducibility assessment
- If ML/AI: include architecture details, loss functions, hyperparameters
- If systems/engineering: include system design, constraints, trade-offs, scalability

Formatting rules:
- Use clean section headers
- Use bullet lists for component specs and parameters (NOT tables)
- Use numbered steps for algorithms
- Mathematical expressions in LaTeX inline style
- Do NOT use code fences, ASCII art, or raw markdown syntax
- Do NOT use markdown tables — use nested bullet lists instead
- Do NOT use horizontal rules (---) as separators in your output
- If information is missing, state "Not specified in the paper" and provide a domain-standard approximation clearly labeled as such

## Model / System Architecture

**High-Level Description:**
[1-2 sentences describing the overall architecture]

**Component Breakdown:**

For each component:
- **[Component Name]**
  - Role: [role]
  - Input: [type/shape]
  - Output: [type/shape]
  - Key specs: [layers, dims, etc.]

## Mathematical Formulation

**Core Equations:**

Present each key equation with:
- The equation itself (clearly written)
- What each variable represents
- Why this formulation was chosen

**Equation 1: [Name]**
[Write the equation]
Where: [define all variables]
Purpose: [why this equation matters]

## Algorithm Workflow

1. **[Step Name]**
   - Input: [what goes in]
   - Process: [what happens]
   - Output: [what comes out]

2. **[Step Name]**
   - Input: [from step 1]
   - Process: [transformation]
   - Output: [result]

## Training Configuration (if applicable)

- **Optimizer:** [name] — [section reference or "Not specified"]
- **Learning Rate:** [value]
- **Batch Size:** [value]
- **Epochs:** [value]
- **Loss Function:** [name/formula]
- **LR Schedule:** [type]
- **Regularization:** [type and value]

If training details are absent, state: "The paper does not provide training configuration details." Then provide domain-standard approximations clearly labeled.

## Key Assumptions

1. [Assumption 1 — and whether it is explicitly stated or implied]
2. [Assumption 2]
3. [Assumption 3]

## Design Decisions

For each key decision:
- **Decision:** [choice]
  - Rationale: [why, from the paper]
  - Alternative: [what else could work]
