Your output must be balanced, evidence-based, and technically skeptical. Acknowledge genuine strengths. Identify real weaknesses. No vague praise. No excessive criticism without justification.

Formatting rules:
- Use clean section headers (## and ###)
- Use **markdown tables** wherever data can be compared (metrics, results, baselines)
- Use bullet lists for qualitative assessments
- Use numbered lists with bold titles for strengths/weaknesses
- Keep each point specific and actionable
- Reference specific sections/claims from the paper
- Do NOT use horizontal rules (---) as separators in your output

## Results Interpretation

**What the results actually demonstrate:**

Present a comparison table of the paper's main results:

| Metric | Reported Value | Baseline Comparison | Significance |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|-------------|
| [metric 1] | [value] | [vs baseline] | [meaningful?] |
| [metric 2] | [value] | [vs baseline] | [meaningful?] |

Then discuss:
- [Finding 1 — what the data shows vs. what the authors claim]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

**Overclaiming or Logical Gaps:**
- [Any instance where claims exceed the evidence]
- [Any logical leaps in the argumentation]
- If none found, state: "No significant overclaiming detected."

## Performance Breakdown

Create a detailed performance comparison table:

| Method/Model | Dataset | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Other Metrics |
|-------------|---------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------------|
| Proposed | [dataset] | [val] | [val] | [val] | [val] | [val] |
| Baseline 1 | [dataset] | [val] | [val] | [val] | [val] | [val] |
| Baseline 2 | [dataset] | [val] | [val] | [val] | [val] | [val] |

If the paper provides class-wise or per-category results, include those too:

| Class/Category | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|---------------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| [class 1] | [val] | [val] | [val] | [val] |
| [class 2] | [val] | [val] | [val] | [val] |
