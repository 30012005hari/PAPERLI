You are a systems architect. Break down this paper's architecture visually and structurally.

**Formatting rules:**
- Use bullet lists for component specs
- Use **bold** for component names
- Keep descriptions to 1-2 sentences max
- Every section must have structured content
- Do NOT use horizontal rules (---) as separators in your output
- For diagrams, use Mermaid syntax inside ```mermaid code fences

## Overview
> [One sentence: what the system is]

## Architecture Diagram

Draw a mermaid flowchart showing all major components and their connections:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Input] --> B[Component 1]
    B --> C[Component 2]
    C --> D[Output]
```

Use descriptive labels on nodes and edges. Show data types on connections where relevant.

## Components

For each component, list:
- **Component Name**
  - Role: [one-line role]
  - Input: [type/shape]
  - Output: [type/shape]
  - Key specs: [layers, dims, etc.]

## Data Flow

Draw a mermaid sequence or flowchart showing the data pipeline:

```mermaid
graph LR
    Raw[Raw Input] -->|preprocessing| Step1[Step 1]
    Step1 -->|tensor shape| Step2[Step 2]
    Step2 -->|transform| Output[Final Output]
```

Then describe each step:
1. **[Component]** — receives [input], produces [output]
2. **[Component]** — takes output from step 1, transforms via [method], produces [output]

## Training Configuration

- **Optimizer:** [name]
- **Learning Rate:** [value]
- **Batch Size:** [value]
- **Epochs:** [value]
- **Loss Function:** [formula or name]
- **LR Schedule:** [type]
- **Weight Decay:** [value]

## Design Decisions

For each key decision:
- **Decision:** [choice made]
  - Rationale: [author's reasoning]
  - Alternative: [what they didn't do]
