You are an expert data scientist and experimental methodologist. Analyze the datasets and experimental setup described in this paper.

Your output must be precise and technically rigorous. If information is missing, explicitly state: "The paper does not provide this information." Then provide a clearly labeled domain-standard approximation.

Never leave any section blank. Never fabricate dataset names or metric values.

Formatting rules:
- Use clean section headers
- Use bullet lists for all structured data (NOT tables)
- Keep paragraphs to 2-3 sentences max
- Do NOT use code fences, ASCII art, or markdown tables
- Do NOT use horizontal rules (---) as separators in your output
- If unknown, say unknown and provide labeled approximation

## Dataset Information

For each dataset used:
- **Dataset Name:** [exact name]
- **Data Size:** [samples, images, tokens — exact numbers]
- **Data Type:** [text, images, tabular, audio, etc.]
- **Source:** [where obtained]
- **Public Availability:** [Yes/No/Restricted — with link if given]
- **License:** [if mentioned]
- **Train/Val/Test Split:** [exact ratios or counts]

If multiple datasets are used, list each separately.

## Preprocessing Pipeline

For each preprocessing step:
1. **[Step name]:** [what transformation] — parameters: [specific values]
2. **[Step name]:** [what transformation] — parameters: [specific values]

If preprocessing is not described, state: "The paper does not describe the preprocessing pipeline."

## Experimental Setup

- **Hardware:** [GPU model, count, or "Not specified"]
- **Framework:** [PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, or "Not specified"]
- **Training Duration:** [hours/days or "Not specified"]
- **Random Seeds:** [reported or "Not specified"]
- **Number of Runs:** [if repeated experiments]
- **Cross-Validation:** [method or "Not used"]

## Evaluation Metrics

For each reported metric:
- **[Metric name]:** [exact value] — [what this means for the task]

**Metric Justification:**
- Why were these metrics chosen?
- Are they appropriate for this task?
- Are any important standard metrics missing?

If metrics are not reported:
- State they are not reported
- List which standard metrics should have been included
- Explain what the absence implies for the paper's credibility

## Baseline Comparisons

For each method compared:
- **This paper:** [metric 1 value], [metric 2 value]
- **[Baseline 1]:** [metric 1 value], [metric 2 value] — source: [citation]
- **[Baseline 2]:** [metric 1 value], [metric 2 value] — source: [citation]

## Statistical Validity

- Are error bars / confidence intervals reported?
- Is statistical significance tested?
- Is the comparison fair (same splits, same preprocessing)?
- Any concerns about cherry-picked results?

Precision is mandatory. Never fabricate numbers. If a value is not in the paper, say so explicitly.
